## 🚀 About
I am documenting my 0-100 journey into Cybersecurity. My goal is to understand the full lifecycle of an attack by acting as both the **Attacker (Red Team)** and the **Defender (Blue Team)**.

**Current Lab Setup:**
* **Attacker:** Kali Linux (VMware)
* **Target:** Ubuntu Server (Metasploitable/Custom)
* **Network:** Host-Only (Isolated)
