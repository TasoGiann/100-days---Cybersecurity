# 🛡️ Day 11: Linux Log Analysis (Blue Team)

## 📝 Executive Summary
After spending 10 days simulating attacks, I shifted to the Blue Team perspective to analyze the digital footprint left behind. Using Linux's native logging facility (`/var/log/auth.log`), I was able to identify the exact artifacts generated by my previous brute force and privilege escalation attacks.

## 💻 Forensic Analysis

### 1. Detecting the Brute Force (Hydra)
On Day 5, I attacked the SSH service. In the logs, this appears as a massive spike of "Failed password" events occurring within seconds of each other.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | head -n 10
Evidence: The logs show repeated login failures from the attacker IP (192.168.160.130), indicating an automated dictionary attack rather than a user mistyping their password.

2. Detecting Privilege Escalation (Sudo)
On Day 7, I abused a sudo misconfiguration. While the attack felt "stealthy" at the time, sudo logs every command execution.

Command:

Bash

sudo grep "COMMAND" /var/log/auth.log | grep "python"
Evidence: The log clearly shows the user ubuntu executing python3 with root privileges, specifically running the payload to spawn a shell (/bin/sh). This is definitive proof of compromised credentials being used for elevation.
